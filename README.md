**Please do not contact me regarding this project anymore.**

I no longer wish to be associated with this project.

I do not play this game, I never have.

I cannot help you set up a server.

I cannot help you figure out why the game crashes.

I cannot help you implement X/Y/Z feature.

I cannot help you get the game to work on consoles.

I cannot provide you with the game binaries.

The code that was in this repository was solely here for educational purposes and to help preserve an online game that was to be lost to history.

**I do not mean to be rude to anyone about this, but please, I beg of you: leave me alone.**
